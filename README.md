# palindrome_number
This code can take in any number as an input and tell you if it is a palindrome number or not.

Methods

Started by changing the input to a string.
Split the string into an array of each individual number.
Iterated backwards over the number and pushed each iteration into a new array.
Joined the new array together to make the backwards version of the original input.
Conditional statement comparing the original number to the backwards version.
(If the same, return true. If different, return false)

Also, in the conditional statement I compared the original number as a string to the backwards version as a string.
